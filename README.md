Challenge Program
ECS60 - Data Structures and Algorithms 
 
Simulation of a CPU -- including organizing, distributing and clearing memory when asked by the tester program. Aims to minimize virtual memory as well as real memory usage. Application of linked list to store the memory blocks, which tracked amount of memory lent out and "deleted" memory. Redistribute "deleted" memory block if possible.
